# Community Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the spirit of the **Contributor Covenant** (v2.0) with clarifications for a **non‑profit, community‑maintained, volunteer‑run** endeavour.  
Our goal is to ensure every participant feels welcome, respected and safe.

---

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Examples of positive behaviour

* Showing empathy and kindness toward others  
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints and experiences  
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
* Acknowledging mistakes, apologising and learning from them  
* Focusing on what is best for the community, not just ourselves  

### Examples of unacceptable behaviour

* Sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention  
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
* Public or private harassment  
* Publishing others’ private information (e‑mail, physical address, etc.) without explicit permission  
* Other conduct reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

---

## Scope

This Code applies to **all** project spaces—GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, chats—as well as when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces (e.g. conference talks, social‑media posts under the project name).

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Because the project is volunteer‑maintained, **all maintainers share enforcement responsibility**.  
Maintainers listed in [`MAINTAINERS.md`](./MAINTAINERS.md) have authority to:

* Remove or edit comments, commits, issues or other contributions that violate this Code.  
* Temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviour they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.

> **Note:** We have no paid staff; responses are best‑effort and may take time.

---

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour:

1. **Prefer private channels first.**  
   * Use GitHub’s private “Report abuse” link on a comment or profile, **or**  
   * E‑mail any maintainer listed in `MAINTAINERS.md` with the subject “CoC Report”.  
2. Include as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing (links, screenshots, context).  
3. Reports are handled confidentially; your identity will not be revealed without consent, except as required by law.

## Enforcement Process & Consequences

| Level | Community Impact | Typical Consequence |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| **1. Correction** | Low‑impact inappropriate language or behaviour | Private warning; request for change. |
| **2. Warning** | Single serious incident or repeated infractions | Public or private warning; temporary exclusion from project spaces. |
| **3. Temporary Ban** | Sustained inappropriate behaviour | Time‑limited ban; conditions for return specified. |
| **4. Permanent Ban** | Pattern of violations, harassment or aggression | Permanent removal from all project spaces. |

Maintainers may skip levels depending on severity.
