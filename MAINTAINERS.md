## How to Become a Maintainer

We welcome new maintainers! Typical path:

1. **Consistent contributions**  
   * 3+ merged PRs in the last 6 months **or**  
   * Regular Issue triage / review activity.
2. **Demonstrated code review**  
   Review at least two PRs from others with constructive feedback.
3. **Familiarity with project policies**  
   Read and accept `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
4. **Nomination**  
   Open a Discussion titled “Maintainer Nomination: @your‑handle” and gather +1s from existing maintainers.
5. **On‑boarding**  
   If consensus is reached, you will receive write access and be added here.

## Maintainer Responsibilities

* Triage new Issues and Discussions.  
* Review Pull Requests for style, correctness and scope.  
* Merge PRs when at least one other maintainer has approved, or if trivial.  
* Tag releases and draft changelogs.  
* Uphold the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md).

## Decision Process

* **Lazy consensus** – If no maintainer objects within 5 days, a proposal is accepted.  
* **Blocking** – Any maintainer may block with a reasoned objection; discussion continues until consensus or the Lead Maintainer decides.  
* **Emergency fixes** – Security patches may be merged by a single maintainer after private review.

## Stepping Down

Life happens! If you need to pause or leave:

1. Add a note in the Maintainers chat or Discussion.  
2. (Optional) Remove yourself from the GitHub *Collaborators* list.  
3. The next active maintainer will update this file.

Thank you for helping keep the project healthy.
